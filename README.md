# FinalProyectAlchemy (Sweet Bet)

Sweet Bet is a decentralized gambling game, it is developed on the logic of Russian Roulette. There is only one loser in each play and the other members win.

The smart contract was not created by me, however it was edited and broken down to call its functions and create the front end that we can see in this Dapp. You could say that I recycled the smart contract from an existing game of Russian roulette and turned it into a new game with another wonderfully sweet approach.

The smart contracts in this game were compiled and deployed on Harhat on the Polygon network thanks to learning from Alchemy University.

I made test instances to communicate with the contracts using Alchemy SDK /scripts/test.js.....However I worked my project with the web3.js library with the help of AlchemyWeb3.createAlchemyWeb3.

The front end is old school, I still don't know how to work well with React :( that's why you can see some visual and non-responsive errors.

P.S: I am not a programmer, I am a Chemical Engineer passionate about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Computer science has always been my hobby and that is why I study it in a self-taught way. Now I dream of working as a Blockchain developer :)
